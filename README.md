Simple Project that picks a restaurant for you. This project is tailored specifically for my use. The restaurants are located in Irvine/Orange County area.

## About The Project

Do you want to save time picking a restaurant? If you said yes to any of the questions, Then that is exactly why im building this project to save time and pick restaurants based on your liking. Do you want a restaurant suggestion that is fast? what about healthy? Restaurant-Picker has the right recommendation for you! Are you ready to celebrate a special event? Restaurant-Picker has a recommendation for that too! Waste no more time deciding, and more time enjoying :)
